<h1> Prediction of human activity in a smart home using Machine Learning on data collected by IoT sensors</h1><br>
Leonardo M. R. Santos<br><br>
<b>Abstract.</b> This work addresses the training and comparison of several machine-learning algorithms to attempt to predict what activity is being carried out at one specific moment by a smart home resident. More specifically, it deals with the problem of <i>human activity recognition</i>.
